A simple currency converter web app built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
I created this project to learn how **API calls** work and how to fetch and display real-time exchange rates using the [Fawaz Currency API](https://github.com/fawazahmed0/currency-api).

## 🌍 Features
- Real-time currency exchange rates
- Dropdowns with country flags
- Default conversion from USD to INR

- ## 🛠 Tech Stack
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Fetch API

📘 Learning Goal: Understanding how to make API calls and dynamically update the DOM based on fetched data.
